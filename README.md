Teachable Machine
Train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, & poses.
A fast, easy way to create machine learning models for your sites, apps, and more, no expertise or coding required.

What is Teachable Machine?
Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. 
(Note: you can find the first version of Teachable Machine from 2017)

# How do I use it?

+ Gather
Gather and group your examples into classes, or categories, that you want the computer to learn (Gather samples that reads Train Model)

+ Train
Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.Video: Train your model of a desktop and mobile web browser containing a sample teachable machine project

+ Export
Export your model for your projects: sites, apps, and more. You can download your model or host it online.

# What can I use to teach it?
Teachable Machine is flexible – use files or capture examples live. It’s respectful of the way you work. You can even choose to use it entirely on-device, without any webcam or microphone data leaving your computer.

+ Images
Teach a model to classify images using files or your webcam.
+ Sounds
Teach a model to classify audio by recording short sound samples.
+ Poses
Teach a model to classify body positions using files or striking poses in your webcam.

The models you make with Teachable Machine are real TensorFlow.js models that work anywhere javascript runs, so they play nice with tools like Glitch, P5.js, Node.js & more.
Plus, export to different formats to use your models elsewhere, like Coral, Arduino & more.
